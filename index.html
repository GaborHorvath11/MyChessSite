                        <h3>Welcome to my website</h3>

                        <p>My name is Gabor Horvath. I am originally from Hungary, but I am currently living in Bournemouth,  South West England. This site is about my hobby: playing and teaching chess. I have put a few of my games and some chess related photos here.</p>

                        <h4>My chess story</h4>

                        <p>I learnt to play chess from my father when I was six. I joined to my first chess club KSE Szekszard in my hometown at the age of fourteen, but after a few years I switched for the club Decs and sticked to it until I left Hungary in 2008. Our club took junior coaching very seriously: we had two weekly training sessions for juniors with professional coaches IM Bela Molnar and IM Gyula Meszaros. No wonder that two of my teammates (GM Gyula Pap and WGM Anna Rudolf) later became GMs.</p>

                        <p>We were also like an affiliate club of the big club ASE Paks so we regularly trained together with ASE players like the future GMs Gabor Pap (winner of the 2016 World Chess Open), Ferenc Berkes, or Peter Acs (both junior world champions).
                        I really enjoyed these junior trainings when I was a kid and I think that is one of the reasons why I am interested in coaching myself.</p>

                        <h4>Ireland</h4>

                        <p>In 2007 I moved to Ireland. After spending two months in Dublin, I settled down in Galway where I played for the Galway Chess Club and also did some coaching in local schools. I spent one year in Galway, and I met Tania, my wife-to-be there who happens to be Brazilian, so in 2008 we moved together to...</p>

                        <h4>Brazil, Espirito Santo, Vila Velha</h4>

                        <p>...where my wifeâ€™s family lives. We stayed over there four years and I worked as an English teacher and a chess coach. This was the first - and probably the last - time in my life when I actually made a (miserable) living of chess! In retrospect, it is quite surprising, because there is not much chess life in Vila Velha... But somehow I managed to do it.</p>

                        <h4>Back to Europe - Belfast</h4>

                        <p>In 2012 we had to come back to Europe due to some problems with my visa. (Luckily enough, because shortly after that the Brazilian economy started to collapse.) First I started to look for a job in Hungary, but I ended up accepting a job in Belfast, thanks to an overly pushy headhunter, so we moved to Northern Ireland in 2013 January.</p>
                        <p>I played a lot of chess in Belfast and I started to work on my chess seriously there, in order to get the IM title one day. (This is still an ongoing project.) I played most of the time for the Lindores Chess Club, until it ceased to exist.</p>

                        <h4>Bournemouth</h4>

                        <p>We were quite happy in Belfast for a while, until we really started to miss the sunshine. It is not easy to get used to 200 rainy days per year, especially if you are Brazilian, as my wife! So we started to look for a sunnier place in the UK, and after some research we decided to give Bournemouth a try. We moved here in August, 2016.</p>

                        <p>2016 was a busy year for us so I only played at one tournament, the Dorset Chess Congress. I managed to win the first prize there. (You can see the games in the My Tournaments 2016 section.) I also started to help to Eric Sachs and his team in running their weekly junior chess coaching session.</p>
